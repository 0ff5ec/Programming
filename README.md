I am constantly putting more and more problems to this repo, but due to very limited time I can put in this, it is going quite slow. If you are willing to contribute to this repository, you are more than welcome!

Right now due to time limitation, the language is mostly python; later on you will see versions in C++, Java and Go as well.
